To do connectome browsing, we wish to have a set of features from a visualization library that include:

* Hierarchical navigation of brain regions to the cellular level
* Discovery of connections from a brain region of interest to all others
* Linking out to original references that define brain regions and connections
* Browser-based technologies that avoid plugins as much as possible
* Extensible architecture to allow future development and "future proofing"
* A data access layer that is reusable by other tools, to ensure appropriate openness
